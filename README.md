# Overview
Thenounproject.com is a website that allows designers to sell icons (specificslly black/clear svgs) to the public. When trying to determine what icons to sell in the future, there are few tools on the website to help designers with analysis beyond just total lifetime downloads, which do not reflect changing trends or purchases vs free/subscripton downloads.

This tool allows contributors to thenounproject.com to scrape their purchase/download data from the activity page of the site, giving output that can be utilized for analysis.
